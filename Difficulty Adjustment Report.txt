Introduction
Hello Bitcoin Investor,
Welcome to the latest edition of the Difficulty Adjustment Report. As your dedicated Bitcoin Investment Manager, I am here to provide you with a first principles perspective on the current state of the Bitcoin market cycle, informed by the most recent blockchain and market data. Today, we will explore the market nuances as of 2023-12-07, paralleling the Bitcoin network's own systematic adjustments.

Current State of Bitcoin
On the date of 2023-12-07, the Bitcoin network's difficulty stands at a formidable 67,957,790,298,897, with a hashrate of 485.013 Exahash. The circulating supply of Bitcoin has reached approximately 19.56 million, which signifies that we have mined roughly 93.14% of the total 21 million cap. The most recent difficulty adjustment occurred at block height 818,496, reflecting a notable 5.07% increase.

This increase in difficulty level is indicative of a robust expansion in the network's mining capacity during the last difficulty period. Such growth is a testament to the miners' sustained investment in computational power, underscoring their confidence in Bitcoin's enduring value and their commitment to maintaining the network's security.

Market Insights
Bitcoin's market capitalization stands at an impressive 846.76 billion USD, with the price per Bitcoin at 43,282.62 USD. This equates to 2,310.40 sats per US Dollar.

The observed 2.57% increase in Bitcoin's price during this difficulty period, coupled with the hashrate growth, suggests a complex interplay between the sentiments and actions of Bitcoin miners and investors. Miners appear to be bullish, reinforcing the network's security and anticipating future rewards, while the modest price increase indicates that investors are cautiously optimistic. They acknowledge Bitcoin's potential for growth but remain wary of its volatility and external economic influences. This delicate equilibrium points to a maturing market where participants are increasingly adopting a long-term view of Bitcoin's trajectory and its potential for expansion.

Performance Analysis

Let's now examine Bitcoin's performance in relation to other notable asset classes and indexes. As of the current report date, Bitcoin has registered a 2.57% return during its difficulty period.

In comparison to the traditional markets listed in the performance table, Bitcoin's difficulty period performance presents a mixed picture. The standout performer in terms of Difficulty Period Return was the BITQ Crypto Industry ETF, which achieved an impressive 13.76% return, highlighting the high-reward potential of the broader crypto industry. Conversely, the US Dollar Index saw a decline of 2.08%, making it the weakest performer during this same period.

The Nasdaq and S&P 500, which are often regarded as indicators of the traditional stock market's health, reported returns of 3.51% and 3.35%, respectively, surpassing Bitcoin for this interval. The XLF Financials ETF, which represents financial sector stocks, led with a 4.49% return, signaling a robust period for the financial industry. In contrast, the XLE Energy ETF lagged with a return of just 1.10%, possibly reflecting sector-specific headwinds or broader market conditions impacting energy stocks.

Gold, traditionally considered a safe-haven asset, slightly outperformed Bitcoin with a 2.91% return. This suggests that investors may have been seeking stability during the difficulty period, a role often fulfilled by gold. The TLT Treasury Bond ETF, which tracks long-term U.S. Treasury bonds, posted a 2.29% return, consistent with the conservative investment approaches that typically favor fixed-income assets during uncertain times.

The FANG+ ETF, which includes highly-traded growth stocks from the technology and consumer discretionary sectors, experienced a -0.44% return, demonstrating that even sectors known for growth are not immune to downturns, in contrast to Bitcoin's positive, albeit modest, performance.

These data points indicate that while Bitcoin did not achieve the highest returns in the difficulty period, it maintained a competitive stance within the array of asset classes. Its positive return, though not the peak, affirms its resilience as an asset class. The diverse performance of other assets emphasizes the value of diversification in an investment strategy. Bitcoin's distinct attributes and its lack of correlation with certain traditional assets, such as the negatively correlated XLE Energy ETF, accentuate its potential as a hedge against sector-specific risks and broader market fluctuations.

In summary, Bitcoin's performance during the difficulty period, when viewed alongside other asset classes and indexes, offers a nuanced perspective that may reinforce investor confidence. It highlights the merit of including Bitcoin in a diversified investment strategy, where it can provide competitive returns and act as a hedge in a multifaceted investment environment.
Historical Performance

Examining the historical data, Bitcoin has demonstrated a year-to-date (YTD) return of 160.63%. To provide a more comprehensive analysis, let's consider the performance metrics over different time frames and compare them with other assets.

Bitcoin's month-to-date (MTD) return is 11.83%, while its 90-day return is a robust 67.08%. This contrast between the MTD and 90-day returns indicates that Bitcoin has encountered short-term fluctuations but has sustained a strong medium-term performance. The substantial YTD return further highlights Bitcoin's impressive long-term gains, signaling a favorable trend for investors who have maintained their positions over this period.

Comparing Bitcoin's YTD return to its historical 4-year Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 54.84%, we observe that the YTD return has significantly outstripped its historical annual growth trend. This suggests that Bitcoin's growth in the short term has accelerated beyond its historical average, offering a bullish outlook for investors. When measured against other assets, Bitcoin's 4-year CAGR surpasses them, underscoring its exceptional growth potential over an extended period.

In terms of performance across various time frames, Bitcoin's returns are outstanding when juxtaposed with traditional assets and indexes. For example, the Nasdaq's YTD return is 37.01%, and the S&P 500's is 19.43%, both of which fall short of Bitcoin's YTD return. Even among ETFs, such as the XLF Financials ETF with a YTD return of 5.09% and the XLE Energy ETF with a YTD return of -6.99%, Bitcoin's performance is superior, reinforcing its status as a potent investment asset.

Investors can utilize the data in the performance table to better understand Bitcoin's price performance in relation to other asset classes. Bitcoin's 4-year Sharpe ratio of 1.956 suggests a highly favorable risk-adjusted return, appealing to investors aiming to optimize returns while accounting for volatility. Moreover, the perfect 90-day correlation with itself of 1.000000 confirms Bitcoin's independence from traditional market movements, providing a diversification advantage.

In summary, the comparative analysis of Bitcoin's historical performance against other notable asset classes and indexes highlights its exceptional growth and investment potential. Its capacity to deliver high returns over short, medium, and long-term periods, combined with its strong historical CAGR, positions Bitcoin as an attractive asset for investors seeking to diversify their portfolios with a high-growth, albeit volatile, asset class.
On-Chain Transaction Activity
In the recent difficulty period, the Bitcoin network has exhibited a steady pace of activity. The transaction count is recorded at 508,626, signifying a decrease in network transactions. Despite this, the transaction volume remains high at $7,091,346,733 USD, indicating a substantial level of capital movement within the network. The average transaction size has reached $12,840 USD, pointing to larger individual transactions. The network also maintains 898,183 active addresses, denoting a stable community of participants in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

The performance of these transaction metrics during the difficulty period reveals a slight contraction in transaction count, yet the economic activity on the Bitcoin network is vigorous, with a significant volume of capital being transferred and a consistent number of active participants.

Miner Economics
The consistent transaction activity on the Bitcoin network is generating moderate revenues for miners. The miner revenue currently stands at $38,495,944 USD, reflecting a challenging yet resilient economic environment for mining operations. Fees generated amount to $7,386,562 USD, constituting approximately 19.18% of the miner's revenue, indicating a stable fee market.

The fees in USD suggest that the network's fee market is crucial in underpinning network security. Although there has been a decline in fees, the proportion of fees to miner revenue remains significant, highlighting that transaction fees are an essential incentive for miners, in addition to block rewards, to maintain the security and operability of the Bitcoin network.

Bitcoin Holder Behaviour
An analysis of holder behavior within the Bitcoin network shows that there are 32,626,359 addresses with balances exceeding 10 USD, reflecting a moderate number of users with investments in the network. Moreover, 70.41% of the current supply has not moved for over a year, demonstrating a strong holder base with a long-term investment perspective. The 1-year velocity stands at 6.13, suggesting a predominant holding trend, which reinforces the perception of Bitcoin as a dependable store of value.

The performance of addresses with balances over 10 USD throughout the difficulty period and year-to-date indicates a consistent growth of investors holding Bitcoin, signaling trust in the network's long-term value proposition. The 1+ year supply percentage underscores the holders' long-term investment outlook, with a significant portion of the supply remaining stationary for an extended period, indicating a robust conviction in Bitcoin's future value appreciation and its status as a store of value.
Bitcoin Valuation Analysis

In this analysis, we delve into Bitcoin's current market price of $43,282.62 to provide investors with a multifaceted perspective on its valuation.

The Technical Price Model, anchored by the 200-Day Moving Average—a benchmark for financial analysis—reveals an average model price of $29,997.81. This figure is 30.69% below the current BTC price, suggesting a potential overvaluation according to this model. The 200-Day Moving Average serves as a barometer for Bitcoin's long-term price direction, and such a discrepancy may indicate a need for market correction.

Investors seeking strategic entry and exit points might consider the buy target, which is set at 0.7 times the 200-day moving average, amounting to $20,905.47. Currently, the market price is 51.70% above this target. Conversely, the sell target is established at 2.2 times the 200-day moving average, or $64,972.25, offering a 50.11% upside from the present BTC price.

This valuation exercise underscores the importance of multiple analytical approaches to understand Bitcoin's market position and to inform investment decisions.
On-Chain Valuation Models

As we examine the on-chain valuation models, we gain invaluable insights into Bitcoin's intrinsic value through its blockchain data. These models offer perspectives on transactional demand, on-chain cost basis, and network revenue, which are pivotal in understanding Bitcoin's market dynamics.

NVT Price Model: Transactional Demand
The NVT Price model compares Bitcoin's market capitalization to its on-chain transaction volume, providing a snapshot of its value in relation to transactional activity. The model price is currently $42,365.45, with a sell target of $88,120.15. This suggests a 103.59% increase to reach the sell target, indicating that the current BTC price may not fully account for transactional demand, hinting at potential growth if transactional activity intensifies.

Realized Price Model: On-Chain Cost Basis
The Realized Price model offers a historical view, showing the average price at which all bitcoins were last transacted. It is presently valued at $21,382.66, with a sell target of $68,060.99, implying a 57.25% increase to the sell target. The disparity between the current price and the sell target suggests that the market sentiment is currently more bullish than the historical realized cost basis, indicating that investors are prepared to pay a premium over the average on-chain cost basis.

ThermoCap Price Model: Network Revenue
The ThermoCap Price model contrasts Bitcoin's market capitalization with cumulative mining revenue, underscoring the economic significance of network security. The current model price is $23,174.63, with a sell target of $73,643.18, reflecting a 70.14% increase to the sell target. This demonstrates the market's valuation of network security, as evidenced by the premium placed on Bitcoin above the total revenue miners have generated.

Stock-to-Flow (S/F) Model: Scarcity Value
The Stock-to-Flow model correlates Bitcoin's price with its scarcity, emphasizing this unique attribute. The current model valuation is $39,588.60, with a sell target of $145,114.01, indicating a 235.27% increase to the sell target. This significant potential rise to the sell target accentuates Bitcoin's scarcity as a fundamental value driver, suggesting that the current market price may not yet fully encapsulate this aspect of scarcity.

In conclusion, these on-chain valuation models collectively provide a comprehensive view of Bitcoin's market dynamics, each contributing distinct insights into its value proposition. The models indicate that Bitcoin's current market price could have substantial room for growth to align with these on-chain sell targets, reflecting transactional demand, historical cost basis, network security, and scarcity.
Relative Valuation Models

Navigating the investment landscape requires a nuanced understanding of Bitcoin's position relative to other assets. By comparing Bitcoin to various benchmarks, we can glean insights into its potential growth trajectory. Let's delve into these comparative analyses.

The Monarch's Money – UK M0:
Comparing Bitcoin to the UK's monetary base (M0) allows us to measure it against a historic global reserve currency. The Sell Target, equating Bitcoin's value with the UK's M0, is $59,294.06, representing a 36.9928% increase from the current price.

Tech Titan – Apple's Market Cap:
Equating Bitcoin with Apple's market capitalization offers a unique perspective. The Sell Target, where Bitcoin's value matches Apple's market cap, is $154,675.71, a substantial 257.3622% increase from today's price.

Dollar Dominance – US M0 Money Supply:
When Bitcoin is compared to the US monetary base (M0), it showcases its potential to challenge the dominance of the leading fiat currency. The Sell Target for Bitcoin to reach the value of the US M0 is $276,535.22, a significant 538.9059% increase.

The Golden Standard:
Gold has been a store of value for centuries, providing a critical comparison for Bitcoin. If Bitcoin were to match the market cap of all mined gold within a decade, the Sell Target would be $551,057.91, a staggering 1173.1622% increase from its current valuation.

Relative valuation models are key to understanding Bitcoin's growth trajectory and adoption cycle. They offer a concrete framework for Bitcoin's valuation by drawing parallels with historically significant and market-accepted assets. These comparisons provide investors with a comprehensive view of Bitcoin's potential market penetration and its value proposition as a long-term investment. By considering Bitcoin's position relative to assets like silver, the UK's M0, Apple's market cap, the US M0, and gold, investors can develop strategies that leverage Bitcoin's unique growth potential and its emerging status as a digital store of value. These insights are crucial for investors to determine strategic investment timings, aligning their decisions with Bitcoin's journey towards mainstream financial recognition.
