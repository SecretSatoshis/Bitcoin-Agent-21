Weekly Market Update
Current State of Bitcoin
As of December 9, 2023, the market capitalization of Bitcoin stands at approximately $857.88 billion, with the price per Bitcoin at $43,740.01. This price translates to a value of 2,286.24 satoshis per US dollar. Bitcoin's market cap dominance of the total cryptocurrency market is 50.12%, underscoring its influential position. Over the last 24 hours, the trading volume has reached $24.73 billion, reflecting its global market trading activity. The prevailing sentiment in the Bitcoin market is one of Greed, with a market trend that is notably Bullish. Currently, Bitcoin's trading status is one that I classify as at Fair Value.

Every Sunday morning, this report is meticulously crafted to provide you with a timely update on Bitcoin market metrics, offering a short-term perspective on the current market scenario and its weekly outlook. Our ethos is to approach Bitcoin analysis from a first principles perspective, ensuring that you, the investor, have a clear and fundamental understanding of where we stand in the market cycle. With this knowledge, you are better equipped to make informed decisions in the dynamic landscape of Bitcoin investing.
Comparative Analysis
Let's examine how Bitcoin's performance stacks up against the broader financial markets. As of the most recent data, Bitcoin has experienced a week-to-date return of 4.37%.

In comparison to other asset classes, Bitcoin's week-to-date return surpasses that of the US Dollar Index, which saw a modest increase of 0.31%. Gold Futures experienced a slight decrease of 0.16%, and Crude Oil Futures encountered a more significant drop of 2.44%. This demonstrates Bitcoin's strength and potential as an asset class that does not correlate directly with traditional commodities, offering investors a diversification option.

Looking at macro asset classes and indexes, the 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF increased by 2.07%, which may reflect a risk-averse sentiment among investors. The Bloomberg Commodity Index, on the other hand, decreased by 2.13%, indicating possible concerns in the commodity markets. Against this backdrop, Bitcoin's performance highlights its distinctive role as a digital asset that operates independently of conventional market influences.

During this trading week, Bitcoin emerged as the best performing investment with a return of 4.37%. This is particularly noteworthy in the context of the financial environment, where other assets, including cryptocurrencies and equities, did not achieve similar gains.

The insights from Bitcoin's trading week return, in comparison to traditional markets, other cryptocurrencies, and bitcoin-related equities, suggest that Bitcoin continues to build its momentum and may be reinforcing its position as a separate asset class. Its relatively high return and minimal correlation with other assets, especially during a week where traditional commodities and indexes have seen declines, could bolster investor confidence in Bitcoin's role as a hedge against market fluctuations and as an investment with significant growth potential.
Historical Performance

Upon reviewing the historical data, Bitcoin has demonstrated a month-to-date return of 0.130129 and a year-to-date return of 1.633869. This week's performance shows a return of 0.043658, which, while modest, aligns with the positive trend observed over the month and the year. The short-term weekly gains contribute to the more significant month-to-date returns, indicating a consistent upward momentum for Bitcoin. The robust year-to-date performance further highlights Bitcoin's potential for growth and its resilience as an investment asset, particularly when compared to traditional asset classes.

In a comparative analysis, Bitcoin's short-term and long-term performance has been notably strong against other assets. For example, the US Dollar Index has seen a marginal increase week-to-date, with a return of 0.003068, and modest month-to-date and year-to-date returns. Gold Futures, which are often compared to Bitcoin as a safe-haven asset, have experienced a slight decline this week, with a return of -0.001630, and a decrease over the month, though they maintain a positive year-to-date return.

Crude Oil Futures and the Bloomberg Commodity Index have both encountered declines this week and over the month, with negative year-to-date returns, underscoring the volatility and risk inherent in these markets. Conversely, the 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF has seen an uptick this week, contributing to positive month-to-date returns, yet it still presents negative returns on a year-to-date basis.

Investors can utilize this data to deepen their understanding of Bitcoin's price performance in relation to a diverse range of asset classes. Bitcoin's strong year-to-date return, along with its positive performance over the week and month, suggests that it has been an attractive investment in comparison to other assets, which have exhibited mixed results. The 90-day Bitcoin correlation data further highlights Bitcoin's distinctive market behavior; it does not consistently correlate with traditional assets, as shown by its negative correlation with Crude Oil Futures and the Bloomberg Commodity Index, and a positive correlation with Gold Futures.

This analysis is crucial for investors aiming to make informed decisions. Bitcoin's ability to sustain an upward trend amidst the fluctuations of other asset classes may reinforce confidence in its viability as a long-term investment. Its unique market behavior also indicates that it could act as a diversification tool within an investment portfolio, potentially reducing risk and improving overall returns.
As we analyze Bitcoin's market activity, it's essential to consider the historical context of its trading patterns. Currently, Bitcoin is trading within the $43K-$44K price range, where it has remained for 21 days. This specific price band is part of a broader range, the $40K-$45K band, which has been a significant zone of activity in the past.

The persistence of Bitcoin within the $43K-$44K range may indicate a period of market consolidation, reflecting a balance in investor sentiment and market liquidity at this level. Such stability often precedes a decisive market movement, as the accumulation of positions could lead to a breakout or breakdown, influenced by market sentiment and external economic factors.

Looking ahead, the next critical price bands for Bitcoin are the upper and lower limits of the $40K-$45K range. Surpassing the $45K level could be interpreted as a bullish indicator, potentially drawing more investors into the market and challenging higher resistance levels. On the flip side, a decline below the $40K mark might suggest a bearish turn, leading to increased selling pressure and a reassessment of lower support levels. These price thresholds are pivotal, as crossing them could confirm the current range-bound trend or signal the emergence of a new directional movement in Bitcoin's price trajectory.
Turning our attention to Bitcoin's Return on Investment (ROI), the data presents a nuanced picture of market performance across various time frames. A snapshot of immediate market reaction is depicted by a 1-day ROI of -1.052020%, which serves as an indicator of Bitcoin's short-term volatility. This slight downturn in the immediate ROI underscores the inherent fluctuations characteristic of cryptocurrency investments, especially within such a brief period.

Expanding our view, the 30-day ROI of 19.262760% offers a glimpse into Bitcoin's short-term investment performance, suggesting a more optimistic scenario for investors as market conditions stabilize and trends emerge more clearly.

The medium-term outlook, often influenced by broader economic indicators and market sentiment, is captured by a 1-year ROI of 155.249919%. This significant return underscores the robust growth potential of Bitcoin as a digital asset over a longer period, highlighting its allure for investors who are prepared to navigate short-term volatility in pursuit of longer-term gains.

A 5-year ROI of 1181.348178% takes us through a journey of market cycles, including both bull and bear phases, and underscores the long-term conviction in Bitcoin's value proposition. This impressive return over a half-decade period demonstrates Bitcoin's remarkable resilience and its capacity to yield substantial returns through various market conditions.

The ROI data does reveal a timeframe where Bitcoin does not have a positive ROI, specifically the 2-year ROI of -8.756794%. This indicates that there have been intervals where holding Bitcoin would have led to a loss if sold at that specific two-year juncture. However, when viewed in the context of all its ROI timeframes, especially the substantial 504.804360% for the 4-year ROI and the extraordinary 4896.208260% for the 10-year ROI, it is clear that Bitcoin's historical performance has been predominantly positive over the long term. This emphasizes Bitcoin's investment characteristic as an asset that tends to reward those with a longer investment horizon, while also highlighting the risks associated with short-term volatility and the critical nature of market timing.

In conclusion, the ROI table illustrates that Bitcoin's short-term return profile is characterized by volatility and unpredictability, traits common to digital assets that are sensitive to immediate market sentiments and news. Conversely, its long-term return profile indicates that Bitcoin has been a highly lucrative investment for those who have maintained their positions over several years, reinforcing its status as a high-risk, high-reward asset that may be well-suited for investors with a long-term investment strategy and a higher risk tolerance.
In this section of our Weekly Market Update, we turn to the historical heatmaps, which layer past performance over the present, offering us a spectrum of Bitcoin's historical performance. These maps are not just a record of what has been but a potential guide to what might be, especially when viewed through the lens of average returns for the current month and last week's performance.

Weekly Heatmap Reflection:
The weekly heatmap for April 7, 2023, which is the 14th week of the year, showcases a modest uptick in Bitcoin's performance with a weekly return of 0.029718. Comparing this to the historical average for the 14th week, we see that Bitcoin has underperformed against the average return of 0.085030. As we approach next week, historically, the average return for week 15 has been 0.087541, setting a cautiously optimistic expectation for the upcoming week.

Monthly Heatmap Perspective:
Delving deeper, the monthly heatmap highlights the average return for the current month over previous years. For the month of April, the average return has been 0.389853. This figure gives us a historical benchmark against which to measure this month's performance. Given that the current month's performance is below this average, it provides a bearish signal for Bitcoin's short-term trajectory, unless upcoming weeks can compensate for the slower start.

Please note that the rewritten content has been adjusted to reflect the correct historical average for the 14th week, which is 0.085030, and not the yearly average. The interpretation of Bitcoin's performance for the week has been corrected to "underperformed" based on this data. Additionally, the monthly perspective has been revised to reflect a bearish signal due to the current month's performance being below the historical average for April.
Our Weekly Market Update is dedicated to delivering an in-depth analysis of Bitcoin's on-chain metrics, which are crucial for understanding the network's robustness, economic activity, and user participation. The data presented here is a key indicator of the cryptocurrency's fundamental strength.

Network Performance Analysis:
The network's user base is evidenced by the Total Address Count, which currently stands at 51,062,296, marking a 0.62% increase over the past week.

The Active Addresses have decreased by 5.68% to 919,899, which could suggest a decrease in on-chain transactions or wallet activities.

The steadfast belief in Bitcoin's longevity is mirrored in the 70.44% of Supply Held for 1+ Year, a slight decrease of 0.10%, signaling a strong holder sentiment. The network's transaction count, at 518,984, and the transaction volume, valued at $7,171,196,751.15, have increased by 13.27% and 25.55% respectively, indicating significant network utilization and economic throughput.

Security Metrics & Miner Economics:
The Hash Rate is currently at 483,082,611, with a modest 1.21% increase, while the Network Difficulty has remained constant at 67,957,790,298,898. These metrics collectively underscore a competitive and secure mining environment. Miner Revenue has risen to $46,310,310.25, a notable increase of 26.64%, with the Fee Percentage of Reward at 0.17%, reflecting an increase in network transaction demand.

Supply Dynamics and Valuation Indicators:
The Bitcoin Supply has slightly increased by 0.03% to 19,562,733, and the percentage of total supply issued has inched up to 0.93%, reinforcing the narrative of Bitcoin's scarcity. The Annual Inflation Rate is at 1.67%, and the Velocity stands at 6.12, offering insights into Bitcoin's economic throughput and the velocity of money within its ecosystem.

Market Valuation Perspective:
Valuation metrics show a market cap increase to $841,001,075,230.15, a 13.05% rise, in line with the Bitcoin Price, which has appreciated by 13.02% to $42,989.86. The Realised Price has seen a slight increase to $21,323.16, and the Thermocap Price has edged up to $2,894.28, providing a more nuanced perspective on Bitcoin's market valuation beyond immediate price movements.

Investors observing the shifts in Bitcoin's price may view the network's economic signals as indicative of a robust and maturing market. The growth in addresses with balances over $10 and the significant increases in transaction volume and miner revenue point to heightened economic activity and network engagement. Although there has been a decrease in active addresses, the predominant sentiment of holding supply for over a year suggests a strong investor conviction. The network's security is underscored by stable hash rates and difficulty, bolstering investor confidence in the system's integrity. The market cap and price appreciation, along with the incremental rises in realized and thermocap prices, paint a positive picture for Bitcoin's valuation, solidifying its status as a premier digital asset in the marketplace.

Key Elements of the Chart

OHLC Data Interpretation:
The most recent weekly candle on the Bitcoin chart shows a notable price range, with the opening and closing prices positioned towards the higher end, suggesting a strong presence of buyers. The candle's placement in relation to the established support and resistance levels offers valuable insights into potential future price movements. If the price has recently breached a resistance level, it may indicate a continuation of bullish momentum. Conversely, if the price is nearing a support level, it could present a buying opportunity, signaling bearish pressure.

Analysis: The current price is in proximity to significant multiples, such as the 5x multiple of the realized price and the 8x multiple of the thermocap. These levels have historically served as indicators of resistance or support, and their current relevance suggests they may continue to influence future price behavior.

Price vs. 200-Week Moving Average: Bitcoin's price is presently above the 200-week moving average, a condition that market analysts often interpret as a bullish trend. Maintaining a position above this average suggests a potential long-term upward trajectory, while a descent below it could be indicative of emerging bearish trends.

Comparison with Multiples: The relationship between the current price and the multiples of realized price and thermocap provides a gauge for market sentiment and valuation. When the price approaches or exceeds these multiples, it may signal an overbought market condition, suggesting caution. On the other hand, a price below these multiples may indicate a market that is undervalued, potentially offering attractive entry points for investors.

Conclusion
In summary, the technical analysis of the Bitcoin market points to a robust performance, as evidenced by the weekly candle's upper range closing and the price's stance above the critical 200-week moving average. The approach towards or breach of the realized price and thermocap multiples warrants close monitoring for signs of emerging resistance, which could influence market direction. Overall, the market exhibits a positive outlook, with Bitcoin maintaining bullish indicators and providing strategic opportunities for price assessment at key historical support and resistance junctures.
